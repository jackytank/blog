            Hi, I'm a guy who loves science/geopolitics/programming/history, and this website was made with 25% my
            code & 75% of
            other people's code & AI
            <br />
            <br />
            It's mainly made for me to document my brain's thoughts and ideas about various topics, but you can read it
            too if you want.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tech stack is: Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS v4.1, Nuxt Content, and a bit of AI magic.
